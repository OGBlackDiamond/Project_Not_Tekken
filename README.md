#### Programming:

##### Caden - BlackDiamond:
Caden is an aspiring software engineer who learned to code with python when he was 12. He continued to expand his knowledge and skills, specifically prefering game development, but lacking the art skills to do anything meaningful. He started the project, reaching out to some of his friends who he knew were artists to help him make a game. They were suprisingly interested in the idea. Within a matter of days, 4 more people joined to assist in development.
